;; Sane defaults

;;; Code:

;; Auto revert non file buffers
(customize-set-variable 'global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)

;; Revert buffers when the underlying file has changed
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)

;; Use spaces instead of tabs
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; Use "y" and "n" to confirm/negate prompt instead of "yes" and "no"
;; Using `advice' here to make it easy to reverse in custom
;; configurations with `(advice-remove 'yes-or-no-p #'y-or-n-p)'
;;
;; N.B. Emacs 28 has a variable for using short answers, which should
;; be preferred if using that version or higher.
(if (boundp 'use-short-answers)
    (customize-set-variable 'use-short-answers t)
  (advice-add 'yes-or-no-p :override #'y-or-n-p))

;; Turn on recentf mode
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'recentf-mode)
;; (customize-set-variable 'recentf-save-file
;;                         (expand-file-name "recentf" crafted-config-var-directory))

;; Do not save duplicates in kill-ring
(customize-set-variable 'kill-do-not-save-duplicates t)

;; Emacs supports bidirectional editing which means that scripts, such as Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew,
;; whose natural ordeing is of horizintal text for display is from right to left.
;; Whilst this is a great feature, it adds to the amout of line scans Emacs has to do for rendering
;; text. So we're disabling it.
